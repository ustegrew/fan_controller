# Eval: Detector

KiCad project for an evaluation board providing a fast detector for an AC signal >= 15kHz. This eval board will be realized on a protoype matrix board (pitch 2.54 mm).

Carrier sensitivity can be adjusted.

Detector provides an open collector output. Output is driven low (0V with respect to GND) when no carrier signal is being detected.
